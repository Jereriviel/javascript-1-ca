            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>
              Founded in the north of Norway, RainyDays emerged from a group of
              enthusiastic outdoor adventurers who were determined to confront
              the region's unpredictable weather with gear that could stand the
              test of any climate. Established in 2011, RainyDays began with a
              single mission: to craft the finest waterproof and durable sport
              jackets that cater to the needs of the avid explorer, regardless
              of the season or weather condition.
            </p>
            <p>
              The founders, a trio of lifelong friends and avid hikers, noticed
              a gap in the market for high-quality, versatile outdoor attire
              that could seamlessly transition from a casual hike to a rigorous
              skiing trip. They pooled their savings, invested in premium
              materials, and collaborated with experts in textile technology to
              develop their first line of jackets. The result was a range of
              products that not only provided exceptional protection from the
              elements but also maintained comfort and style—qualities that
              quickly made RainyDays a beloved brand among outdoor enthusiasts.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the company grew, so did its range of offerings. Today,
              RainyDays is a beacon for outdoor apparel, providing a robust
              catalogue of jackets that are celebrated for their craftsmanship,
              innovation, and ability to empower adventurers to explore the
              great outdoors in comfort and style.
